# pythonAutoClicker
Here is an AutoClicker written in Python. Copied from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-a-python-auto-clicker/, but some changes were made for it to use a Key Combination instead of a single key.

The project is created using the venv -- Python's virtual environment. In order to run the program, you have to use the python binary stored in a `bin` directory of a project, not a global one!

There are some one-line scripts that do this for you under Linux ("programStart.sh") and under Windows ("programStart.bat").

### Key Bindings

| Ctrl + Alt + J | start/stop the clicker |
| ---------------| -----------------------|
| CTRL+Alt+M | stop the program execution |
